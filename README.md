<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Based on the skipping behavior of users, Spotify seeks to improve its music recommendation engine. 
From an academic standpoint, the Spotify Skip Prediction Challenge offered a unique opportunity for researchers to improve and design state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms using a large, real-world dataset.
The concrete goal of the challenge was to predict whether a listener will skip a certain song or not. After the challenge was concluded in early 2019, the top-performing teams were invited to write papers about how they tackled the challenge. These top-performing teams used the following ideas:
* Feature Engineering
* Embeddings
* Recurrent Neural Networks

This project contains some notebooks you could use to get started on the Spotify Skip Prediction Challenge yourself.

## Results
More information can be found in following pdf document describing the challenge and our results: [Spotify_Challenge_Report](https://github.com/Djensonsan/Spotify_Challenge).

### Built With
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation
In order to run the notebooks, you can either use a Jupyter Notebook server or Google Colab. 
Note: to run these notebooks on a Jupyter Notebook server some small changes might have to be made.

1. Create a Google Colab account
2. Go to: [Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
3. Click open notebook and choose Github
4. You should be able to search for an organisation or user
5. Choose a notebook you want to open

### Notebook Overview
* [exploration](https://github.com/Djensonsan/Spotify-Sequential-Skip-Prediction-Challenge/tree/main/exploration/): contains some data wrangling and a simple regression classifier. Also contains some exploratory code, PCA analysis etc.
* [pre-trained-embedding](https://github.com/Djensonsan/Spotify-Sequential-Skip-Prediction-Challenge/tree/main/pre-trained-embedding): contains a notebook for training a Word2Vec embedding, the track IDs are the 'words'.
* [similarity measures](https://github.com/Djensonsan/Spotify-Sequential-Skip-Prediction-Challenge/tree/main/similarity-measures/): contains a notebook that will calculate the mahalanobis distance between a track's vectors and the mean representation of tracks in the same session.
* [RNN](https://github.com/Djensonsan/Spotify-Sequential-Skip-Prediction-Challenge/tree/main/models): contains an RNN model based on LSTM networks. 


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
As can be seen in the notebooks, the larger datasets are stored on the Cloud.
You can download the data yourself here: [Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge).
